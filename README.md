Fantasy Football draft picker

Determine which player to draft. Filter out which players have already been drafted and filter which player to draft by position or overall. 

Player stats are from ESPN's api ([more info here](https://gist.github.com/nntrn/ee26cb2a0716de0947a0a4e9a157bc1c)) and fantasy points are calculated from [these metrics](https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/37707148/how-play-fantasy-football-draft-basics-rules).
This picker determines optimal draft pick by who scored the most points last season.

Future Updates:
  - experiment with regression models for Fantasy Point predictions (in progress)
  - UI with input fields and display results
